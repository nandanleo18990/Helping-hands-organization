			One of the greatest evils is the foolishness of a good man.
		For the giving man to withhold helping someone in order to first assure personal 
		fortification is not selfish, but to elude needless self-destruction; 
		martyrdom is only practical when the thought is to die, else a good man faces 
		the consequence of digging a hole from which he cannot escape, and truly helps no one in the long run</p>

		“I want you to understand that your first duty is to humanity. I want others to look at us and see that we care not just about ourselves but about others.”
― Madam C.J. Walker 

“It's not how much we give but how much love we put into giving.”
― Mother Teresa

“The most treasured and sacred moments of our lives are those filled with the spirit of love. The greater the measure of our love, the greater is our joy. In the end, the development of such love is the true measure of success in life.”
― Joseph B. Wirthlin

“That's what I consider true generosity: You give your all, and yet you always feel as if it costs you nothing.”
― Simone de Beauvoir
